/*

Style sheets are organised in the following folders using sass and gulp

00-Settings – used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.
01-Tools – globally used mixins and functions. It’s important not to output any CSS in the first 2 layers.
02-Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.
03-Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.
04-Components – specific UI components. This is where most of our work takes place. We often compose UI components of Objects and Components
05-Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes before in the triangle, e.g. hide helper class
